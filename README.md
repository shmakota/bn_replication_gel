![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41fd6e02-c801-41d7-94f3-6436615ff498)

## Summary

- Adds the `FRG-7 gel` item, a consumable item that replicates another item when activated.
- The replicated item will not include:
  - Any nested or contained items (e.g. items inside backpacks, mods on weapons).
  - Any ammo, charges, or internal fuel.

This means you can copy a gun, but not the bullets. A backpack, but not the contents. A tool, but not the batteries.

## How to Get It

- Nanofabrication.
- Rarely found in `military` and `rare` itemgroup spawns.

## Use Case

Select the gel from your inventory, target an item, and the gel creates a duplicate nearby. The gel is destroyed in the process.

This is not meant to be perfectly balanced. It's designed for fun, testing, or late-game resource manipulation.
